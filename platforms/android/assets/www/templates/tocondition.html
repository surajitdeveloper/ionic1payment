          <h4>Product Disclaimers</h4>
          All names and the Services shall be made available on the Application alone, and no requests shall be entertained to grant access to the services or the Product in a manner not designed by us. 
          The display of names as a result of a particular Subscription to the Product is based on the choices made by you, such as, without limitation, the choice pertaining to alphabets and gender. These choices are irreversible and will affect the type of names displayed to you. Kindly choose with caution. There shall, however, be no restriction on the number of subscriptions you choose to avail. Thus, in the event you desire, you may avail names pertaining to multiple alphabets, or both genders, upon payment of the requisite Fees for each alphabet and gender. 
          The name lock feature is available to select users and shall be at the discretion of the Company. Should you desire to avail this feature, you may contact us at contactus@uniquesikhbabynames.com. Please note that the feature is available to users subscribing to specific plans. 
          The display of the meaning of any particular name in a given language shall be based on the manner in which the name is written in that language, as per commonly used meanings, phrases, expressions. As with linguistics, it is possible that any meaning ascribed to a particular name on the Application is different from the one ascribed by a third-party. It is hereby specified and clarified that all representations and warranties pertaining to the names, the Product, and the Services, are based on the inference drawn by us, which shall be binding over inferences drawn by the user or third parties, in the event of a dispute, or otherwise. 
          The unique name check feature offered on the Product or as part of the Services is based on the results of a google or other third-party internet search, and the inferences drawn therefrom by us. If a particular name, ascribed as unique, is displayed to the User, it does not mean that such a name has not been displayed to other users. The extent of representation made with respect to the unique name feature is that, on the day the name ascribed as unique is displayed to the user, the results of a Google or third-party internet search lead us to believe that the name does not relate to any social media or other online presence generally present in the event the name in question has been used to refer natural persons alive at the time of the search. 
          However, as these names are displayed to other users as well, we cannot guarantee, and a user should not expect, that the name shall remain unused (as afore-stated). 
          Your access to the Application, the Product, and the Services may be subject to delays, interruptions, and errors.
